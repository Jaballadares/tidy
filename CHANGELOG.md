# 2.0.0 (2021-02-01)

## BREAKING CHANGES
* **pivotLonger** `cols` now requires you to specify the columns with values to pivot on, matching tidyr's behavior. (This is the inverse of what it did previously, accidentally)

## Features
* **count** now takes a `wt` option
* **tally** now takes a `wt` option
* **pivotLonger** `cols` now works with selectors, similar to **select**
 
# 2.0.0-alpha.2 (2021-01-05)

## BREAKING CHANGES
* Long-form calling of functions is no longer supported. i.e. `mutate(items, { value: 123 })` no longer works. This was done to simplify the code and types with aim of improving type inference. It is now recommended you either do `tidy(items, mutate({ value: 123 }))` or `mutate({ value: 123 })(items)`.
* **groupBy** has been reworked to improve types and to better clarify what is grouped. It now receives a tidy subflow (an array of tidy functions) as its second parameter. Additionally, the **fromGroups** methods have disappeared and are now activated by specifying a third option to **groupBy**. Examples:

```js
// before
tidy(
  data,
  groupBy('str')
  summarize({ summedValue: sum('value') })
  ungroup()
);

// after
tidy(
  data,
  groupBy('str', [
    summarize({ summedValue: sum('value') })
  ])
);
```

Example that would previously use objectFromGroups:

```js
// before
tidy(
  data,
  groupBy('str')
  summarize({ summedValue: sum('value') })
  objectFromGroups()
);

// after
tidy(
  data,
  groupBy('str', 
    [summarize({ summedValue: sum('value') })], 
    groupBy.object())
);
```

* groupBy exports renamed options from **transformLeaf** and **transformEntry** to **mapLeaf** and **mapEntry**.


* **mutate** has been renamed **mutateWithSummary** and a new **mutate** has been added. The new **mutate** works on single items at a time, while mutateWithSummary can look across the entire dataset. Example:

```js
// before
tidy(
  data,
  mutate({ val: byItem(d => d.x * 4) })
)

// after
tidy(
  data,
  mutate({ val: d => d.x * 4 })
)
```

```js
// before
tidy(
  data,
  mutate({ total: sum('value') })
)

// after
tidy(
  data,
  mutateWithSummary({ total: sum('value') })
)
```

Note that if you are using vector functions like **roll** or **cumsum**, you must now use **mutateWithSummary**.

* **byItem** and **byRow** have been removed, use **mutate** instead.
* **transmute** and **total** now mutate by item via **mutate**, no longer with **mutateWithSummary**.
* **rate** and **TMath.rate** now by default convert divisions by zero to `undefined` instead of `Infinity`. This can be configured by an options parameter.
* **rate** now operates on single items, not vectors (i.e., it is no longer usable with **mutateWithSummary**, but is designed to work with **mutate**).
* **summarizeMomentGranularity** has been moved to its own package called **tidy-moment**.
* **innerJoin** and **leftJoin** now have reversed their join mapping to `{ JoinTKey: Tkey }` (previously was `{ by: { TKey: JoinTKey }}`) to get better type inference.
* If using TypeScript, requires version 4.1 to handle template literal types.


## Features
* Added **when** for conditionally running tidy subflows
* Improved types and type inference
* **groupBy** now has an option `assignGroupKeys` (default: true) that allows you to disable assigning group keys back into objects.
* Added **negate**, a modifier for selectors that negates the output of a given selector. e.g. `negate(startsWith('foo'))` might give you `['-foo', '-foobar']`.

## Chores

* Switched to a mono-repo design with lerna + yarn workspaces
* Switched to using conventional commits



# 1.1.1
- Expanded granularity values allowed for fullSeqDateISOString, fullSeqDate, and summarizeMomentGranularity to make them consistent. 

# 1.1.0

## Convert From Groups Functions
- *new* **levelsFromGroups** was added to allow exporting grouped data where the format varies for each level in the grouped structure. For example, export the first key as entries then the rest as an object.
- **entriesFromGroups** transformEntry now receives the current level as a second argument.

# 1.0.2

## Tidy Functions
- **mutate** Fixes a bug where mutate broke if the mutated value was null or undefined.

# 1.0.1

## Tidy Functions
- **summarizeMomentGranularity** fixes bug where the operation didn't work when passed daily granularity.


# 1.0.0

- New documentation site now up.

## Tidy Functions
- Types for many functions have been modified to reduce incorrect type inference. In some cases this results in more loose types returned, as opposed to incorrect ones. 
- *new* **slice**, **sliceHead**, **sliceTail**, **sliceMin**, **sliceMax**, **sliceSample** Select subsets of the data
- *new* **summarizeMomentGranularity** New function to rollup data using Moments, requires a peer dependency of moment 2.0.0 or greater to work.
- *new* **debug** Added a helper to see intermediate output in the console.
- **summarizeAt**, **totalAt** now accept selectors as input in addition to key strings.
- **sort** now is an alias for **arrange**.

## Vector Functions
- *new* **cumsum** Compute a cumulative sum
- **rate** Now accepts a predicate option to only compute the rate if it passes.


# 0.0.5

## Tidy Functions
- **summarize** Added options argument that currently only takes `rest`. Specify a summary function that will be called on all the keys that were not specified in the summary spec. Commonly combined with **first** or **last** (see below).
  - **BREAKING** This new option argument means that full calls to summarize must now pass a third argument. e.g. `summarize(items, { foo: sum('foo') })` will no longer work. You must call `summarize(items, { foo: sum('foo') }, null)` or `{}` or `undefined` as the last argument. This does not affect calls to **summarize** within a `tidy(...)` flow.

## Summary Functions
- *new* **meanRate** Convenience function for summarizing rates / percents. Sums up numerator and sums up denominator then divides at the end. 
- *new* **first** Use the first value seen in the dataset.
- *new* **last** Use the last value seen in the dataset.

## Vector Functions
- *new* **roll** Use with mutate to compute rolling aggregations (e.g. moving averages).

## Helper Functions
- *new* **TMath.rate** Computes a rate, handling null numerators or denominators and the case when both numerator and denominator are zero. NOTE: export name may change in future.
